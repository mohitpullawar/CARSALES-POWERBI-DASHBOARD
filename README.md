# CARSALES
Power BI project focused on building an interactive Car Sales Dashboard for a dealership. It analyzes YTD and MTD sales, YOY growth, average price trends, and cars sold metrics. Visuals include sales by body style, color, dealer region, company-wise trends, and a detailed sales data grid for actionable insights.
